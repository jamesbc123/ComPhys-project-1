plotting.py is a script for making plots for the report using toi.csv.

Results is a folder with all the plots and tables. 

Report is a folder containing the pdf of the report.

./Results/toi.csv is the table of information where most data is stored before plotting. Note: this table could not be uploaded as it was in the range of 1.6GB, the limit is 100MB. Please run the main.py script to create the toi.csv on your computer before running plotting.py.

main.cpp is a c++ script to solve the poisson equation.

gaussElim.cpp contains the function which are called by main.cpp.

gaussElim.h is the header file. 

project1_amund.py is an additional script for solving the poisson equation.
